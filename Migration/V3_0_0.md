# v3.0.0 - Changelog & Migration Guide

Endpoints 3.0.0 introduces new native `async` APIs as well as a lot of other new features, therefore it was necessary to break some of our interfaces.

## Changelog
### Developer facing
- Removed wrapping withCheckedContinuation functions and rewrote APIs in a native async way
  - Dropped `AsyncXXXX` prefixed components because async is the only supported way
  - Adopted tests based on that change
- Validation
  - Request and Response validation is now triggered in the Session `dataTask` function.
- Added [EndpointsTestbed](./EndpointsTestbed) as an example project
  - this includes a MVVM as well as an [AsyncReactor](https://github.com/diamirio/AsyncReactor) example
- Updated README.md based on the new APIs

  
### Internal
